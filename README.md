## GENERAL INFORMATION:

Universal Tweaks is a modification that enhances existing gameplay elements by modifying things within [**The Long Dark**](https://www.hinterlandgames.com/the-long-dark/) that just make sense.

### Features:
- **Mod Settings Support:** Most of these features listed below are now customisable with [**Mod Settings**](https://github.com/DigitalzombieTLD/ModSettings).
- **Flashlights:** Now continue to function after an aurora is over, but are only charged and flicker during an aurora. Now also start with a random charge!
- **Snares:** Can now be reset from the inspect menu after a rabbit is captured.
- **Revolvers:** Can no longer lock the player's movement; feel free to walk while aiming.
- **Spray Paint:** Restrictions can be changed to how close they can be placed to one another. 
- **Pies:** Can no longer give the player the `Headache` debuff.
- **Snow Shelters:** Can now decay slower based on the players requirements.
- **Breath Effects:** Can either be enabled or disabled, merged from [**Disable Breath Effects**](https://github.com/Thekillergreece/DisableBreathEffect) by [**Thekillergreece**](https://github.com/Thekillergreece) and [**zeobviouslyfakeacc**](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc).
- **Toilet Water:** Now either start as Potable or Non-Potable, merged from [**TLD_NonPotableToiletWater**](https://github.com/Ezinw/TLD_NonPotableToiletWater) - by [**Ezinw**](https://github.com/Ezinw).
- **Left-Handed Animations:** Players can now swap animations to the left hand! `WARNING: IS EXPERIMENTAL - WILL NOT FUNCTION AS EXPECTED.`
- **New MRE Variant:** Implemented a new brown MRE textures from the traditional blue.
- **UI Fixes:** Spray paint option is now greyed out in radial, unless there is one in your inventory. `Wintermute` label will only show if it's installed. Sprite realignments.

>**Note**: Many of these features were suggested by people in [**The Long Dark Modding Discord**](https://discord.gg/2mnXAZfGXQ). If you have a request, either create an [**issue**](https://github.com/Deaadman/UniversalTweaks/issues) or ask me in the discord!
