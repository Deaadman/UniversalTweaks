## GENERAL INFORMATION:

Universal Tweaks is a modification that enhances existing gameplay elements by modifying things within [**The Long Dark**](https://www.hinterlandgames.com/the-long-dark/) that just make sense.

### Features:
- **Flashlights:** Now continue to function after an aurora is over, but are only charged during an aurora.
- **Snares:** Can now be reset from the inspect menu after a rabbit is captured.
- **Revolvers:** No longer lock the player's movement; feel free to walk while aiming.
- **Spray Paint:** No longer has any restrictions on how close they can be placed to one another.
- **Pies:** No longer give the player the `Headache` debuff.
- **Snow Shelters:** Now decay twice as slow.

>**Note**: Many of these features were suggested by people in [**The Long Dark Modding Discord**](https://discord.gg/2mnXAZfGXQ). If you have a request, either create an [**issue**](https://github.com/Deaadman/UniversalTweaks/issues) or ask me in the discord!
